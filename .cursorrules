# Cursor Rules for MMO Project

## Terminal Command Restrictions

**NEVER run npm commands automatically:**
- DO NOT run `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, or any other npm scripts
- DO NOT run `npm install` or any package management commands
- DO NOT start development servers or build processes
- DO NOT run turbo commands like `turbo run dev` or `turbo run build`

**When testing code:**
- Ask the user to run servers manually
- Only make code changes, don't run commands to test them
- Let the user decide when and how to run their development environment

**Exception:** Only run terminal commands if explicitly requested by the user for specific tasks (like creating directories, moving files, or other non-npm operations).

## Development Workflow
- Focus on code changes and fixes
- Let users manage their own development servers and build processes
- Respect user's control over their development environment
